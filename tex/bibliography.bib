<p>The three-dimensional structure of a protein enables it to perform its specific function, which may be catalysis, DNA binding, cell signaling, maintaining cell shape and structure, or one of many other functions. Predicting the structures of proteins is an important goal of computational biology. One way of doing this is to figure out the rules that determine protein structure from protein sequences by determining how local protein sequence is associated with local protein structure. That is, many (but not all) of the interactions that determine protein structure occur between amino acids that are a short distance away from each other in the sequence. This is particularly true in the irregular parts of protein structure, often called loops. In this work, we have performed a statistical analysis of the structure of the protein backbone in loops as a function of the protein sequence. We have determined how an amino acid bends the local backbone due to its amino acid type and the amino acid types of its neighbors. We used a recently developed statistical method that is particularly suited to this problem. The analysis shows that backbone conformation prediction can be improved using the information in the statistical distributions we have developed.</p>
