\Head{Summary}

\vspace*{-.7cm}
In this work we investigate a strategy for predicting the structure of proteins. Given a so-called \emph{\Ca-trace}, we wish to fold the protein to match the trace.

%Protein structure prediction can be simplified by using a model that only includes a subset of the atoms present in proteins. In particular, the algorithms group at our department only predicts a folding of the \Ca-trace, and are thus excluding most backbone atoms and all side-chain molecules.



%The strategy divides the problem into two separate tasks.


%\section{Motivation}
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item[-- ] Proteins are the perhaps most important molecules of
%      living organisms.
%    \item[-- ] Computational resolution of the protein 3D-structure has
%      many applications in biotechnology and medicine.
%    \item[-- ] Protein structure prediction and the related topic protein
%      folding, are large and active research fields.
%    \end{itemize}

\section{Our problem}
Currently, we are only able to predict protein structures at the $C_\alpha$-trace level. 
Our goal with this project is to extend the \Ca-trace with the remaining atoms to get an all-atom model.
The difference between the two is shown in Figure \ref{fig:all-atom_vs_trace}.

  \label{fig:all-atom_vs_trace}
\end{figure}

\section{Our approach}
The strategy we will pursue, is to use a given $C_\alpha$-trace as target when folding a protein model that contains all atoms. The folding should be conducted, such that it minimizes the number of clashes and at the same time minimizes the deviation from the target $C_\alpha$-trace.

We consider our fitting problem as two somewhat separate problems.
First, the backbone must be folded to the \Ca-trace by minimizing
the deviation from the $C_{\alpha}$-trace.  Hereafter, the amino acid
side-chains are added to the backbone.  
%In the following we have chosen to
%consider these two tasks separately.
%However, as we shall see in Section \ref{sec:evaluation_handling_side-chains}, the performance of our residue handling depends heavily on the backbone fitting.
 % (even though the residue handling might require us to adjust the backbone).

    \item Proteins are built from unbranched chains of amino acids.
    \item All amino acids share
      the same basic structure and a variable side-chain.
    \item The structure of an amino acid can be described by bond lengths,
      bond angles and rotational angles.
    \item The bond lengths and bond angles only displays small variations
      between amino acids (see tables)
    \item Only three different rotational angles occurs along an amino
      acid chain. These are named $\phi$, $\psi$ and $\omega$ and are
      shown on Figure \ref{fig:torsion_angles}.

    $180^{\circ}$.
  \item The $\phi$ and $\psi$ angles are the most variable parts of
    the protein backbone and many models use these as the only
    parameters when performing protein structure prediction.
  \item The $\phi$ and $\psi$ are the only parameters we modify when
    folding the backbone in place.

\Head{Backbone fitting}

\textit{Bond lengths} are the distances between the covalently bonded atoms
in a molecule (usually measured in ångstrøm). We will name the
individual bond lengths by the name of the two atoms which the bond
connects. For example, the bond between a \Ca\ and N atom in an amino acid of
the protein backbone is called \Ca -N. We have computed bond lengths
for all bonds in the backbone, the results are shown in Table
\ref{tab:average_bond_lengths}. As can be seen from the last column in
the table, the variation is very limited and we therefore have not
found it necessary to consider any variations from the mean
lengths.

\label{fig:lysine}
\end{minipage}

\item The rotational angles of side chains are named
  $\chi_1$-$\chi_5$, but many amino acids only have one or two of
  these angles.

\item Each side chain tends to have certain configurations of its
  $\chi$-angles. These often occuring configurations are called
  rotamers of the side-chain.

\item There exists rotamer libraries containing these common
  configurations together with their likelyhood.

\item We have developed a rotamer search algorithm that minimizes the
  number of occurences, which uses the rotamer-probabilities as a good
  initial guess.

%\item[-- ] We can obtain a RMSD of less than $0.2$ Å with our devised
