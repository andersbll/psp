Until now we have ignored the protein side chains. In this section we
will deal with the problem of adding side chains and selecting side
chain conformations in a way that minimises the number of collisions.

As we mentioned in Section \ref{chap:protein_geometry}, protein side
chains tends to appear in certain conformations.
