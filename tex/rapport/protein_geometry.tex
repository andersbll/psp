The representation of proteins shown in the structure diagram of
Figure \ref{fig:amino_connect} is suitable for determining the
chemical properties of the molecules, how atoms are arranged and the
bonding between atoms. However, to describe an exact model of the
protein structure we need a more precise characterization. That is, we
need to include the concepts of bond lengths, bond angles and
torsional angles into the model. Refer to Figure
\ref{fig:protein-torsion-angles} while reading the following
explanation of these concepts. 

\section{Backbone geometry}
\textit{Bond lengths} are the distances between the individual atoms
in a molecule (usually measured in Ångstrøm). We will name the
individual bond lengths by the name of the two atoms which the bond
connects, e.g. the distance between a \Ca\ and N atom in a amino acid
is called \Ca -N. We have computed bond lengths for all bonds in the
backbone, the results are shown in Table \ref{}.

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lrr}
    \toprule
    Bond & Avg. bond length & Variance \\ \midrule
    C-O   & 1.225998 Å & 0.01883672\\
    CA-C  & 1.527209 Å & 0.01907005\\
    N-CA  & 1.468014 Å & 0.02368912\\
    C-N   & 1.323387 Å & 0.02145554\\
    N-H   & 0.979301 Å & 0.03419159\\
    CA-CB & 1.532714 Å & 0.02276761\\
    CA-HA & 1.074718 Å & 0.03070158\\ \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \vspace{1mm}

\end{table}

A \textit{bond angle} is an angle between two outgoing bonds from a
single atom. As an example, the between the bonds N-\Ca\ and \Ca -C'
is called N-\Ca -C'. Table \ref{} shows average values for the
backbone bond angles.

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l>{$}r<{^\circ$}>{$}r<{$}}
    \toprule
    \multicolumn{1}{c}{Bond} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Avg. angle} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Variance} \\ \midrule 
    H-N-CA & 118.9553 & 1.9979\\
    N-CA-C & 123.7803 & 3.2434\\
    CA-C-O & 120.7088 & 1.3064\\
    CA-C-N & 116.7804 & 1.7682\\
    C-N-CA & 121.4547 & 1.9946\\
    C-N-H  & 119.5112 & 2.1599\\ \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \vspace{1mm}
  \caption{Average bond angles}

\end{table}

A torsional angle is rotational angle around a bond. In the backbone,
there are three of such torsional angles. The $\phi$ and $\psi$ angles
was mentioned earlier. The last one, the $\omega$-angle, is almost
always $0^{\circ}$ and sometimes $180^{\circ}$ according to
\cite{probik}. We will assume that the $\omega$ angle is \textit{always}
$0^{\circ}$. \fixme{or do we assume this?}. To be more precise the
three torsional angles can be defined as dihedral angles between two
planes. For example, the $\phi$ angle can be described by the angle
between the two planes defined by the atoms C'$_{n-1}$, N$_n$ and \Ca $_n$ as well
as N$_n$, \Ca $_n$ and C'$_n$.

% As mentioned in our introduction, the largest variability of the
% protein structure is found in the \textit{torsional} angles between
% the individual $C_\alpha$-atoms \cite{lotan04}. These angles are
% termed $\phi$ and $\psi$ in the literature, Figure
% \ref{fig:protein-torsion-agnles} illustrates their definition.
