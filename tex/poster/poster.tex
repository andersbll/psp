  \Head{Motivation}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item[-- ] Proteins are the perhaps most important molecules of
      living organisms.
    \item[-- ] Computational resolution of the protein 3D-structure has
      many applications in biotechnology and medicine.
    \item[-- ] Protein structure prediction and the related topic protein
      folding, are large and active research fields.

  \Head{Protein structure} 
  \textit{Bond lengths} are the distances between the covalently bonded atoms
in a molecule (usually measured in ångstrøm). We will name the
individual bond lengths by the name of the two atoms which the bond
connects. For example, the bond between a \Ca\ and N atom in an amino acid of
the protein backbone is called \Ca -N. We have computed bond lengths
for all bonds in the backbone, the results are shown in Table
\ref{tab:average_bond_lengths}. As can be seen from the last column in
the table, the variation is very limited and we therefore have not
found it necessary to consider any variations from the mean
lengths.

%\Head{Conclusion}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item[-- ] We can obtain a RMSD of less than $0.2$ Å with our devised
%  variant of cyclic coordinate descent
%\item[-- ] Selecting the appropriate rotamers makes it possible to
%  reduce the number collisions to 1 for every 4700 amino acids on a
%  realistic protein.
