% Set up the grid

% Note that [40mm,40mm] is the margin round the edge of the page --
% it is _not_ the grid size. That is always defined as 
% PAGE_WIDTH/HGRID and PAGE_HEIGHT/VGRID. In this case we use
% 15 x 25. This gives us a wide central column for text (7 grid
% spacings) and two narrow columns (3 each) at each side for 
% pictures, separated by 1 grid spacing.
%
% Note however that texblocks can be positioned fractionally as well,
% so really any convenient grid size can be used.

    \Head{Motivation}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item[-- ] Proteins are the perhaps most important molecules of
      living organisms.
    \item[-- ] Computational resolution of the protein 3D-structure has
      many applications in biotechnology and medicine.
    \item[-- ] Protein structure prediction and the related topic protein
      folding, are large and active research fields.

  \Head{Protein structure} \\\textit{Bond lengths} are the distances between the covalently bonded atoms
in a molecule (usually measured in ångstrøm). We will name the
individual bond lengths by the name of the two atoms which the bond
connects. For example, the bond between a \Ca\ and N atom in an amino acid of
the protein backbone is called \Ca -N. We have computed bond lengths
for all bonds in the backbone, the results are shown in Table
\ref{tab:average_bond_lengths}. As can be seen from the last column in
the table, the variation is very limited and we therefore have not
found it necessary to consider any variations from the mean
lengths.

\Head{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
\item[-- ] We can obtain a RMSD of less than $0.2$ Å with our devised
  variant of cyclic coordinate descent
\item[-- ] Selecting the appropriate rotamers makes it possible to
  reduce the number collisions to 1 for every 4700 amino acids on a
  realistic protein.
