Use probability maps to accept or reject $\phi$ and $\psi$ angles proposed by the CCD-algorithm.

Some method\texttrademark\ to detect when backbone is folded making side-chain collisions inevitable

\section{Experiment with Hydrogen atoms}
How large is the variability of the hydrogen atoms in the backbone and
side-chains? How hard would it be to add hydrogen atoms on to an
otherwise full model of the protein? If the hydrogen atoms are easy to
add later, we could post-pone the problem of adding them and thereby
simplifying our model.
